# Predator-Detection-Subsystem---EEE4113F

This repository contains the source code for a microcontroller-based predator detection subsystem, designed to operate autonomously with low power consumption and high detection reliability. The system uses PIR sensors and an OV2640 camera interfaced with an STM32 microcontroller, performing real-time image comparison using an efficient RGB565 tolerance matching algorithm.
